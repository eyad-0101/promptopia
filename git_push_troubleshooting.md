# Git Push Troubleshooting Instructions

## Steps to Resolve "src refspec main does not match any" Error

1. **Check the Current Branch**:
   - Run the following command to see the current branch name:
     ```
     git branch
     ```

2. **Create a New Branch if Necessary**:
   - If the branch is not named "main", you can create a new branch named "main" using:
     ```
     git checkout -b main
     ```

3. **Make Sure There Are Commits**:
   - Ensure that you have made at least one commit. If not, add files and commit them:
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

4. **Push to the Correct Branch**:
   - Push to the GitHub repository using the correct branch name:
     ```
     git push -u origin main
     ```

Follow these steps to resolve the error and successfully push your changes to GitHub.
